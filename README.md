##Transformer-Based Language Model (GPT-1.0 Inspired)

###Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

```bash
project/
├── data/
│   └── text_data.txt                # Preprocessed training data (WikiText-103)
├── models/
│   └── transformer_model.py         # Transformer model architecture
├── utils/
│   └── data_preprocessing.py        # Data preprocessing utilities (tokenization, vocab building)
├── train.py                         # Script for training the transformer model
├── generate.py                      # Script for generating text using the trained model
└── vocab.pkl                        # Saved vocabulary for encoding/decoding
Setup and Installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/transformer-language-model.git
cd transformer-language-model
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Use the following command to install them:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch numpy datasets tqdm
Step 3: Download and Preprocess the Data
The dataset will be automatically downloaded from Hugging Face's dataset library. Run the train.py script to load, tokenize, and preprocess the WikiText-103 dataset.

Training the Model
To train the model from scratch, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
The model will train for the specified number of epochs (default: 50).
Training loss will be printed at the end of each epoch.
The trained model will be saved to transformer_model.pth for future use.
Model Hyperparameters:

d_model: 64 (embedding size)
num_layers: 2 (number of decoder layers)
num_heads: 8 (multi-head attention heads)
d_ff: 256 (feed-forward network hidden layer size)
batch_size: 2
seq_length: 10
epochs: 50
These hyperparameters can be tuned for larger models or datasets if required.

Generating Text
Once the model is trained, you can generate text by running the generate.py script:

bash
Copy code
python generate.py
Provide the starting text (seed) in the script to generate sequences of words based on the trained model. The generated text will be printed to the console.

Future Improvements
Larger Model: Increase the number of layers, model dimensions, and training epochs for better results.
Advanced Tokenization: Implement byte pair encoding (BPE) for improved tokenization.
Use of GPUs: Train on larger datasets using GPUs for faster training times.
Implement Attention Masking for Long Sequences: Scale the model for longer text sequences.
